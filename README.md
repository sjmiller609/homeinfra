this is a project for a nearly 100% automated set up of my home infrastructure

there is a script to build an unattended install ubuntu 16.04 iso

so you would run that, answer prompts, then dd to your usb
this part i didn't automate because i want to do the dd manually


then there are ansible roles to set up my home systems how i like them

todo:
up next - connect unattended install to the ansible stuff so it happens automatically
manage data we would like to persist between disk formats
